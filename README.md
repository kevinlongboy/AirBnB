## 🌊 Welcome to Seattle

... And welcome to CraneBnB, a virtual meeting place that connects visitors, and the like, to the finest _guest maisonettes_ in the Greater Seattle Area. Inspired by <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" alt="AirBnB website">AirBnB</a>, CraneBnB allows its members the ability to host visitors in their own homes, or become guests in other members' spaces.

Don't miss this truly once in a lifetime opportunity to experience what Seattle has to offer. _Where else can you see an ocean wave, a fish fly, a mountain peak, and the world's largest needle?_

## 👀 Overview

When navigating the site, users have the option to choose between the role of a Host, a Guest, or perhaps even both!

### Spots

_The main feature of CraneBnB_

As a Host, users are able to list their home on the site and highlight its best qualities in the listing. Hosts should give a brief description of their home, henceforth known as a "Spot", then choose a befitting rate for a nightly stay.

As a Guest, users are able to peruse through CraneBnB to find the perfect place for their stay in Seattle.

### Reviews

_Hear the peoples' voice_

CraneBnB gives its members the ability voice their opinions and share their experiences from previous stays.

Users can also modify and delete any reviews they've previously posted.

## ⏳ Future Implementations

### Bookings
Bookings will supplement the Spots feature with functionality. Guests will be able to make, modify, and delete a reservation for a Spot, while Hosts will be able to view and manage any reservations for their own listings.

### Images
Images feature will bring life to both Spots and Reviews. Hosts will have the ability to add, modify, and delete images for their Spot listings, and Guests will be able to do the same for any reviews they've written.
